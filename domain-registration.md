## What is a Domain Name?

Think of a domain name as the street address for your website or server on the internet. While computers use long strings of numbers called IP addresses (like `172.217.14.227`) to find each other, humans find it much easier to remember names (like `google.com`).

A domain name is a human-friendly alias that points to a specific IP address. When you type `www.example.com` into your browser, a system called **DNS** (which we'll cover in the next guide) looks up the corresponding IP address and directs your browser to the right server.

## Key Concepts

-   **Domain Registrar**: A company that manages the reservation of internet domain names. You purchase your domain from a registrar. Examples include GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, and Squarespace.
-   **Top-Level Domain (TLD)**: The last part of the domain name. Common TLDs include `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.io`, and country-specific ones like `.co.uk` or `.ca`.
-   **WHOIS Information**: When you register a domain, you must provide contact information (name, address, email). This information is stored in a public database called WHOIS.
-   **WHOIS Privacy**: Most registrars offer a privacy service (sometimes for free, sometimes for a fee) that hides your personal contact information from the public WHOIS database and replaces it with their own. **It is highly recommended to enable this.**

## How to Choose and Register a Domain Name

Choosing the right domain name is important for branding and memorability. Here are a few tips:

-   **Keep it short and simple**: Easy to type, easy to remember.
-   **Make it brandable**: A unique, catchy name is better than a generic one.
-   **Avoid numbers and hyphens**: These can be confusing for users to type and say.
-   **Choose the right TLD**: `.com` is the most popular and recognized TLD, but others like `.io` or `.ai` are popular in the tech space.

### The Registration Process (General Steps)

While the user interface of each registrar is different, the process is always very similar:

1.  **Choose a Registrar**: Select a domain registrar. For this guide's examples, we'll assume you might be using Squarespace, but the principles apply everywhere.
2.  **Search for Availability**: Use the registrar's search tool to see if your desired domain name is available. If it's taken, they will usually suggest alternatives.
3.  **Add to Cart and Select Term**: Once you find an available name, add it to your cart. You'll need to choose the registration period, which is typically one year, but you can often register for longer.
4.  **Provide Contact Information**: Fill out the required WHOIS contact details. This is a legal requirement.
5.  **Add WHOIS Privacy**: Look for an option to add domain privacy or WHOIS protection. **We strongly recommend you add this service.**
6.  **Complete the Purchase**: Pay for your domain registration.

Congratulations! You now own a domain name.

## What's Next?

Now that you have a domain, the next step is to understand how to manage it and point it to a server. This is handled by the Domain Name System (DNS).
